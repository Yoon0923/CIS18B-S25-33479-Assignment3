The Java program simulates a simple banking system that allows users to deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and view transaction logs. It applies a withdrawal limit of $500 per transaction using object-oriented programming principles such as custom exception handling, observer patterns for logging transactions, and decorator patterns.

To run the program, compile 'BankAccountTest.java' using 'javac' and run it as 'java'. The user will be asked to enter the initial balance, deposit, and withdrawal. Exceptions for invalid tasks such as negative deposits, overdrafts, or exceeding withdrawal limits will be handled.
